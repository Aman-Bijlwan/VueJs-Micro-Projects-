# Vue.js Micro Projects ðŸš€
Welcome to my Vue.js Micro Projects repository! This collection serves as a playground for diving deep into various concepts of Vue.js. I'm documenting my journey here, not just for others but mostly as a guide for my future self. These small projects cover different aspects of Vue.js, from the basics to more complex interactions, offering a hands-on way to reinforce my learning.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside?
### 1. Todo App
- This project is all about mastering reactive UI using v-model, computed, watch, and ref. Itâ€™s a simple Todo List that helps me understand how Vueâ€™s reactivity system works.
- The most interesting part was implementing local storage, ensuring the data persists even after the page is refreshed. Future me, youâ€™ll appreciate the smooth user experience this provides!
### 2. More Projects Coming Soon
- I plan to add more micro-apps here, like projects utilizing Vue Router, Vuex, and even API integrations. This is just the startâ€”thereâ€™s so much more to explore!

This repository is a personal project space designed to grow alongside my knowledge of Vue.js. The projects Iâ€™ve built are small, but theyâ€™re building blocks to mastering the framework.
